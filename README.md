### online-advice tool

To run the shiny app, open R with the working directory set to the root directory of this repository, and run the following:

```r
source("Shiny/advice_shiny_app_stable_version.r")
```

The utilities files and the shape file are in the Shiny folder in which I kept some code in development.
The official ui and server scripts are the ones in the temp folder.
